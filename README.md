# DogTrax

DogTrax is an app that enables dog walkers to manage their clients'information, including adding new dog clients, and writing reports once a dog walk is complete. Inspired by my own dog walking gigs, this app aims to provide dog walkers with an intuitive, easy-to-use customer management system and walk-report-generating capabilities.
