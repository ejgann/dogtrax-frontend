<h1 align="center">:dog2:  DogTrax  :poodle:</h1>

<p align="center">DogTrax is an app that enables dog walkers to manage their clients'information, including adding new dog clients, and writing reports once a dog walk is complete. Inspired by my own dog walking gigs, this app aims to provide dog walkers with an intuitive, easy-to-use customer management system and walk-report-generating capabilities.</p>

## Features
On the homepage, a user can click the link to "Dog Clients" to see a full list of the dogs they currently walk.

Clicking on a dog's name will take the user to that dog's individual page where they can view details about the dog and see the list of walk reports that have previously been logged for that dog. 

The user is able to edit the dog's basic information and also write a new report that will be added to the collection below.

If a user has a new dog client that needs to be added, they can click on the link "Add New Dog" where they will be taken to a form to input the new dog's information.
